Description:
This is a basic HTML project that demonstrates the use of JavaScript to trigger an alert message when the user clicks on a specific element on the webpage. The project utilizes a combination of HTML for structuring the page, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to handle the click event and display the alert message.

Upon loading the page, the user will see a clickable element, such as a button or a text link. When the user clicks on this element, a pop-up alert will appear with a custom message, showcasing the functionality of event handling in web development.

Key Features:

JavaScript Event Handling: The click event is captured using JavaScript.

Alert Message: A simple alert box is displayed when the element is clicked.

Technologies Used:

HTML

CSS (for basic styling, optional)

Objective:
The goal of this project is to practice basic web development skills, particularly event handling in JavaScript. This can serve as a foundational project for learning how to make interactive websites.
